			<h2>Famous skaters</h2>

			<h3>Tony Hawk</h3>

			<p>Tony Hawk has been a household name for many years now and for good reason. You may know him from tv, from his video games, or just in conversation, but you’d have a hard time finding someone who hasn’t heard of him. He’s most famous for performing the first ever 900, where he makes two and half rotations in the air on a skateboard. This shot him into popularity right as the game Tony Hawk Pro Skater was released, so he became even better known. I’m actually in the middle of playing the second game in the installment.</p>
